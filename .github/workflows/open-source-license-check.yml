# as the workflow trigger - however this resulted in runs _after_ a merge to main
# which was not a requirement
# we have instead copied the configuration from the documentation where
# you can configure a workflow to run only for pull requests that target specific branches
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpull_requestpull_request_targetbranchesbranches-ignore
